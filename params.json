{"name":"Evh","tagline":"Evh 2010/2016 Description","body":"\r\n\r\nSharepoint-EventHandlerExplorer\r\n===============================\r\nSharepoint EventHandlerExplorer 2013/2016, tool that allows to register/unregister SharePoint event receivers to specific Webs, Lists/Libs, or Content Types on the fly.\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gennady-G/Gennady-G.github.io/master/EventHandlerExplorer2013.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nDeclarative syntax or code(using features in WSP solutions) allows to add event receivers to standard Lists and libraries, which have known Id's. Usual textbook example is \"Announcements\":\r\n\r\n      <Receivers ListTemplateId=\"104\">\r\n\r\nBut deploy using XML feature is unuseful if You have Custom list and don't know its Id, or if You want to register receiver on one special list, instead of all Announcements in the scope. Or if You want to have two different receivers on two Announcements lists. Or by example I could work with remote employer and don't have access to target list at all.\r\n\r\nEventHandlerExplorer was created by Patrick Tisseghem for WSS 3.0. Since .NET 4.0 there are two types of GAC, so drag-and-drop doesn't work in Windows 2012. For deploy dll in GAC it is recommended to use powershell:\r\n\r\n    [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load('System.EnterpriseServices, Version = 4.0.0.0, Culture = neutral, PublicKeyToken = b03f5f7f11d50a3a');\r\n        $publish = New-Object System.EnterpriseServices.Internal.Publish;\r\n        $publish.GacInstall('$fullpath');\r\n\r\nIn this release I added powershell wrapper to support this GAC deployment, some other improvements and SharePoint 2013/2016 compatibility.","google":"UA-74349689-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
